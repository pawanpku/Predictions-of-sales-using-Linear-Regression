# Predictions-of-sells-using-Linear-Regression
-This project is about the e-commerce company located in New York. Company has website and mobile application through which customer can order clothes. It also has outlet where customer can visit and take the advice from the brand stylist for the clothes. 

- In this project I have predicted the amount of money spend by customer, taking into consideration time customer spends on website , mobile application, and the time when customer has taken membership.

- Analysis:
   - Per unit of increase in average time spent by customer on mobile application resulted in more money spent by customer, whereas in the case of website it was minimal.
   - Amount of money spent by customer was also directly proportional to time for which they have membership of that clothing brand. 
 
#Report- 
-Organization can focus more on the membership of the customer.
- They must focus on mobile application for sales as the amount of money spent through mobile application was relatively high in comparison to website.
